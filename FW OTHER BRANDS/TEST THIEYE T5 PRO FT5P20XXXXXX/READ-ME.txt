📢 Looking for THIEYE T5 Pro (Model FT5P20XXXXXX) Owners

Hi everyone,

I'm currently working on a project involving the THIEYE T5 Pro action camera, specifically the FT5P20XXXXXX model.
However, I do not own this specific camera, so I’m currently unable to test or verify firmware compatibility for it.

If you own this model and are willing to help with testing or provide feedback,
please get in touch—your contribution would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance! 🙏
