 Info & Request: THIEYE T5 Pro (Model FT5P19XXXXXX)

Hi everyone,

I own a THIEYE T5 Pro, model FT5P19XXXXXX, and I‚Äôve tested the AKASO-V50Elite-20190819-V2-C firmware (from the Akaso V50 Elite).
‚úÖ It appears to work perfectly on this camera.

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Not all Akaso V50 Elite firmware versions are compatible!
Over time, hardware revisions can change‚Äîeven for the same camera model.
üëâ Installing an incompatible firmware may damage your device.
‚öôÔ∏è Advice: only install firmware if you are sure of what you are doing.

If anyone would like to contribute by sharing other compatible or working firmware, feel free to contact me!
Any help is appreciated to support other users with the same model.

Thanks!
